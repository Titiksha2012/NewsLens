## Features
- Loads URLs or upload text files containing URLs to fetch article content.
- Processes article content through LangChain's UnstructuredURL Loader
- Constructs an embedding vector using Huggingface's embeddings and leverage FAISS, a powerful similarity search library, to enable swift and effective retrieval of relevant information
- Interacts with the LLM's (Gemini) by inputting queries and receiving answers along with source URLs.

## Usage/Examples
- On the sidebar, you can input URLs directly.
- Initiate the data loading and processing by clicking "Process URLs."
- Observe the system as it performs text splitting, generates embedding vectors, and efficiently indexes them using FAISS.
- The embeddings will be stored and indexed using FAISS, enhancing retrieval speed.
- The FAISS index will be saved in a local file path in pickle format for future use.
- One can now ask a question and get the answer based on those news articles.

## Project Structure
- main.py: The main Streamlit application script.
- requirements.txt: A list of required Python packages for the project.
- faiss_store.pkl: The pickle file will be generated once you run the code. (File too large - not added in the repo.)
- .env: Configuration file for storing the GEMINI API key. (Secret file - not added in the repo.)
